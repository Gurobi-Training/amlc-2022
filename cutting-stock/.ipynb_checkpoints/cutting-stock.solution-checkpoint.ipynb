    "## Problem definition\n",
    "Let’s look at a simple example of a paper mill that needs to minimize operating costs while facing certain constraints. The mill supplies paper rolls or “final rolls” to customers that are cut from a master roll of a given width.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need is to generate a master roll cutting plan that minimizes the cost of cutting and procuring master rolls consumed to satisfy all the demand of the final rolls.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that there is a single machine that cuts the different types of master rolls to satisfy the aggregate demand of final rolls. After a master roll is cut, the left-over (spare) roll may be re-us-able if the spare roll width is larger than a specified threshold width.\n",

    "## Improving on the model formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation has a big problem: symmetry. Every $x_{i,j}$ with the same width can be exchanged for each other. In addition, the $y_j$ is not ordered, i.e. whether we select $y_1$ or $y_{55}$ does not matter. This makes it difficult for the solver to cut away parts of the branch-and-bound tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How can we solve this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable change\n",
    "Instead of introducing a binary variable $x_{i,j}$ for each possible cut, we define $x_{i,j}$ as the **number of times** a cut of a given width is used. This removes the symmetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding an ordering constraint\n",
    "To break the symmetry in $y_j$, we introduce the following ordering constraint:\n",

    "y_j \\leq y_{j-1}, \\quad $ \\forall j > 1\n",
